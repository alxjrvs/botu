# BoomTube — design spec

**BoomTube** is **declarative dev-machine setup**: a single self-contained binary
(executable: **`boom`**), compiled from **TypeScript on Bun**, that converges a
machine to a declared state — dotfiles, packages, and tools from one
`boomfile.toml`, with drift detection and rollback — then opens portals to your code.
Named for Kirby's **Boom Tube** — an instant conduit between worlds —
it opens a portal to your machine's ideal state, and to your code.

It began as a bash prototype (extracted from `alxjrvs/dotFiles`) and was rewritten
to TypeScript; this document is the design of record for that engine.

## The model (decided — don't relitigate)

A `boom` invocation does one of two things:

1. **Reconcile verbs** over a config repo's `boomfile.toml` — the `sync` verb runs on
   the bare `boom source` command (and its explicit `boom source sync` spelling); the
   rest are their own top-level commands:
   - `boom source` / `boom source sync` — reconcile the machine to the boomfile, running the `sync` verb (`--fix` repairs drift by overwriting conflicts; `--update` also updates outdated brew formulae)
   - `boom verify` — check drift, exit 0 ok / 2 warn / 1 fail (`--json` for a report; `--ci`
     narrows to a non-interactive schema-check gate, 0/1, no machine walk)
   - `boom status` — a read-only one-screen dashboard composing the health signals other
     commands already own (config, config-repo drift, last sync + checkpoints, fleet, lock,
     secrets); introduces no new state
   - `boom uninstall`
   These share **one verb-parameterized loop** (`src/engine/reconcile.ts`) over a
   resource-type registry — siblings, not separate scripts. `boom rollback` undoes
   the most recent sync (`--run-id` targets an older one, `--list` enumerates them);
   `source --resume` continues an interrupted one. A
   conflicting (non-boom-owned) file at a `link` destination is **skipped by
   default** (boom never clobbers a file it doesn't own); `source --fix` opts into
   overwriting it — that's how drift is repaired, so there's no separate `fix` verb.
   `sync` is the one canonical reconcile name; bare `boom source` is its shorthand
   (the namespace's default command), not a separate alias.

   The `sync` verb (never `verify`/`uninstall`) also syncs the config repo's own git
   state against its remote first (`src/engine/sync.ts`): by default `pull --rebase
   --autostash`s, so any uncommitted local edits ride along and land back on top;
   `source --commit` commits local edits first instead of autostashing them, so
   they replay as a real commit on the rebase. `boom source push` commits local
   config-repo changes and pushes them (`src/engine/commit.ts`), sharing its commit logic with
   `source --commit` so the default message/behavior can't drift between the two.

2. **Discovered subcommands** — built-ins are the `@stricli` route map (`source`,
   `status`, `init`, `code`, `mcp`, `where`, `rollback`, `upgrade`, `doctor`, `fleet`,
   `module`, `adopt`, `completions`, `man`, `skill`); `fleet` and `module` are themselves
   nested route maps (`fleet drift|diff`, `module search|add`). `boom init` is the greenfield
   cold-start (adopt → `git init` + commit → create remote → push → breadcrumb). User commands
   resolve at runtime from `<config>/commands/<name>.ts`.
   The route map is the **single registry, with no hardcoded dispatch anywhere**: `mcp`
   is an ordinary route (its `-- <server args>` ride through verbatim via the scanner's
   argument-escape sequence, so it needs no pre-Stricli passthrough), and `index.ts`
   decides built-in-vs-discovered by asking the route map itself
   (`getRoutingTargetForInput`). `src/commands/catalog.ts` *derives* command names +
   briefs from that same route map for shell completions, the man page, and `boom skill`
   — one source of truth, no parallel table to keep in sync.

### Config source is a git remote (repo-only)

`boom source set` takes a remote reference — `owner/repo`, `github:owner/repo`,
a full git URL, optionally `@ref` — never an arbitrary local path. Boom clones it into
a managed cache dir (`configRepoCacheDir`, under the state dir) and records the
breadcrumb (`{ path, remote: { url, ref? } }`), then syncs immediately — the
one-command fresh-machine bootstrap is `curl install.sh | sh && boom source set
owner/repo`, no repo-relative bootstrap script needed. `--no-sync` records only (review
first, or re-point at a different repo without reconciling).

Sync is a pre-reconcile step (`src/engine/sync.ts`), not a resource: `verify` fetches
and reports drift without touching the working tree — "N commits behind origin",
plus separate warnings for uncommitted local changes and committed-but-unpushed local
commits, since a clean behind-count alone would otherwise read as "up to date" while
either kind of local drift sits unreported; the `sync` verb pulls first and reports what
moved, then reconcile proceeds against whatever's on disk either way — a failed pull
(including a `git rev-list` failure while checking drift) is reported as a failure but
never blocks reconciling from the last-known-good local clone.

The pull is `git pull --rebase --autostash` (git stashes any dirty tracked changes
before rebasing and restores them after, including automatically on an aborted rebase);
`source --commit` commits local edits first instead of autostashing them
(`src/engine/commit.ts`, shared with `boom source push`).

A rebase conflict aborts cleanly (`git rebase --abort`, which also restores the
autostash) and is reported as a failure, but reconcile still proceeds from the local
state as it was before the rebase attempt.

A pinned `@ref` (tag/sha, detached HEAD) is reported as static rather than checked for
drift. Auth is whatever git/SSH already works in the user's shell — no boom-side
credential handling.

The config-repo git verbs live under one namespace: `boom source status` is the read-only
"how does my clone stand against origin?" (behind / unpushed / dirty, exit 0 in sync / 2
on drift) — the same summary the `verify` path shows, over a shared `repoDrift` helper, but
without also walking the whole machine; `boom source push` commits any local
config-repo changes and pushes the managed clone's commits upstream (`-m`/`--message`
sets the commit message); `boom source reset` is the
other direction — fetches, then hard-resets to the upstream tip (or the pinned `@ref`
for a detached clone) and clears untracked files, discarding local changes back to what
a fresh re-clone would leave. Like `linkRemoteConfigRepo`, `boom source reset` refuses
to discard commits no remote has (listing them) unless `--force` is passed — uncommitted
changes alone don't need `--force`, only unpushed commits do. `linkRemoteConfigRepo`
itself refuses to wipe a managed clone that has either uncommitted changes or commits
not yet pushed (checked separately — `git status --porcelain` never reports
ahead-of-upstream) — `boom source push` or `boom source reset` first, then re-link.

### Config is typed TOML, not code

`boomfile.toml` is a TOML document validated against a schema (`src/config/schema.ts`,
valibot). It is grouped into `[[section]]`s; within a section, resources run in a
fixed phase order:
`link → copy → tmpl → secret → dir → pkg → osx_default → launchd → systemd → run → check → hook`.
Resources:

- `link` / `copy` `= [{ src, dst, mode?, expand? }]` — place a repo file at `dst` (symlink vs
  byte-copy). `src` may be a **glob** (then `dst` is a directory and each match is placed
  under it, structure preserved below the pattern's static prefix). `expand` (copy only)
  substitutes `${env:VAR}`/`${host}`/`${os}` in the content — per-machine files without a hook
- `tmpl = [{ src, dst, mode? }]` — render `src` to `dst`, interpolating `${NAME}` from the
  top-level `[vars]` table (plus the same `${env:VAR}`/`${host}`/`${os}` vocab as `expand`). A
  strict superset of `copy` + `expand`: one template with per-machine `[vars]` replaces N
  near-identical overlay files. An unknown `${NAME}` is a hard failure (never a dangling write)
- `secret = [{ dst, ref? | template?, mode?, backend? }]` — render a secret to a file at sync
  time; `mode` defaults to `0600`. The `backend` is inferred from the ref scheme (`op://`→op,
  `env:`→env, `pass:`→pass, `*.age`→age, `*.sops`→sops) or set explicitly — 1Password
  (`op read`/`op inject`), a plain env var, `pass`, or an age/sops-encrypted file. The
  plaintext is **never journaled or backed up** (undo is a plain remove), and secrets stay out
  of the owned-destinations manifest, so orphan reaping never auto-deletes one
- `dir = [{ path, mode?, remove_on_uninstall? }]` — ensure a standalone directory exists
  (declarative `mkdir -p`/`chmod`); `remove_on_uninstall = true` removes it on uninstall *only
  if empty*
- `pkg = [{ manager, file? }]` — satisfy a package manager. `brew` runs `brew bundle` over
  `file` (default `Brewfile`); `mise` runs `mise install`; `apt`/`dnf`/`cargo`/`npm` (global)/
  `pipx`/`gem`/`flatpak` install a newline-separated `file` package list, each gating on its
  CLI being present (a missing tool is a reported failure, not a crash). One array entry per
  manager; a new manager is one dispatch arm, not a new section key
- `osx_default = [{ domain, key, value, type? }]` — a `defaults write`; `type` is inferred
  from the TOML value (`bool`/`int`/`float`/`string`) and only stated to override an edge
  case. The prior value is journaled, so `boom rollback` restores it (or deletes a key boom
  introduced)
- `launchd = [{ src, dst? }]` — link a macOS LaunchAgent plist into
  `~/Library/LaunchAgents` and own its launchctl lifecycle (`load -w` on sync, `unload` on
  uninstall); darwin-only, `dst` defaults to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/<basename(src)>`
- `systemd = [{ name, exec, description?, timer?, enable?, env? }]` — the Linux twin of
  `launchd`: **generate** a `.service` (and, when `timer` is a systemd OnCalendar expression, a
  `.timer`) into `~/.config/systemd/user` and own its `systemctl --user` lifecycle
  (daemon-reload + `enable --now` on sync, `disable --now` on uninstall); linux-only. Because
  the unit text is generated, an unchanged stanza re-renders byte-identical → a no-op sync
- `run = [{ on, cmd, timeout? }]` — the inline imperative escape; `on` is a verb or a list of
  `"sync"|"verify"|"uninstall"`; `timeout` (seconds) caps a step's wall-clock so a hung
  command can't block reconcile
- `check = [{ path, present?, absent?, message?, missing_file?, repair? }]` — content
  assertions: every `present` regex must match and every `absent` must not. On `verify` this
  folds into the exit code + JSON report; on `sync`, `repair` (a shell command, run only when
  the assertion currently fails) converges it. `missing_file` defaults to `fail`
- `hook = [{ name, with? }]` — load `hooks/<name>.ts`, the TS resource-type extension; `with`
  carries arbitrary (TOML-typed) values, not just strings

A section may carry `when = { os, host, profile }` to gate by machine; overlay
files `boomfile.<os|host|profile>.toml` are merged onto the base. `--profile`
(repeatable) activates named profiles; os/host auto-match (overridable via
`BOOM_OS`/`BOOM_HOST`).

A top-level `use = [<module>, …]` composes other boom config repos — a git remote
(`owner/repo[@ref]`, a URL) or a path relative to this repo — whose sections are merged in
**before** this repo's own (so the repo can override a module). Modules resolve during
reconcile (remotes clone into a cache; a failed resolve warns and is skipped, never fatal);
`boom module` lists them and `--update` re-fetches. A module may itself declare `use`, composed
**recursively** (a resolution-stack guard breaks cycles). `boom module search <term>` / `add
<name>` browse a curated registry of vetted packs and splice a ref into `use`. A top-level
`[vars]` table (a name→string map) supplies the values `tmpl` resources interpolate.

### `[boom]` — machine-global self-wiring

A single top-level `[boom]` table folds boom-invoking-boom behaviors into the reconcile
boom already runs, so a consumer stops hand-rolling `run`/plist boilerplate for them. Every
field is opt-in; an absent (or all-off) table changes nothing. The behaviors are work items
run through the *same* guarded loop as section resources (`runWorkItems`,
`src/engine/settings.ts`) — so skill + timer writes are journaled and `boom rollback`-able —
verb-aware (sync installs/refreshes, verify reports drift, uninstall tears the timers down):

- `skill_on_sync = true` — regenerate `~/.claude/skills/boom/SKILL.md` from the running
  binary each sync, so the self-describing skill can't lag a `boom upgrade`.
- `upgrade_on_sync = "check" | "auto"` — after a sync, warn when a newer release ships
  (offline-safe, never fails the sync), or actually self-upgrade.
- `schedule = [{ cmd, every }]` — install/refresh a launchd timer (macOS-only) that runs
  `boom <cmd>` on the interval, e.g. `{ cmd = "verify", every = "15m" }` to catch drift or
  `{ cmd = "code fetch", every = "15m" }` to keep `origin/HEAD` warm for agent worktree cuts —
  without a hand-authored plist. Removing an entry unloads its timer on the next sync.
- `fleet = true` — after a sync, record this machine's summary (boom version, drift verdict,
  date) into `.boom/machines/<host>.json` in the config repo, so `boom fleet` can show a
  cross-machine view from the repo you already push (`fleet drift` narrows to the machines
  needing attention; `fleet diff <a> <b>` compares two). Low-churn: date-granular, written only
  when it changed.
- `notify = true` — when a (typically scheduled) `boom verify` finds drift, raise a desktop
  notification (macOS `osascript` / Linux `notify-send`) so the signal doesn't die in a timer
  log. Best-effort; a platform with no notifier is a silent no-op.

### Hooks = the resource-type extension contract

`hooks/<name>.ts` default-exports (or names) `sync`/`verify`/`uninstall`
functions receiving a `HookApi`: `{ with, verb, dryRun, env, ok, warn, fail, note }`.
Loaded by runtime `import()` (works inside the compiled binary). This replaces the
bash `_NAME_<verb>` hooks and is the public extension point.

### Transaction + state

On-disk state lives in a single **bun:sqlite** database at
`${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/boom/state.db` (`src/engine/db.ts`): the per-run
transaction journal (intent/done rows + undo token, a `committed` flag) and the `manifest`
of owned destinations. Each journal row commits atomically (WAL), so an interrupted run
leaves whole rows — there's no torn-record to guard against on read. A mutating run holds
an exclusive lockfile under the state dir (`src/lib/lock.ts`) so two concurrent
sync runs can't race on destinations or clobber each other's manifest; a stale lock
from a crashed run (dead pid) is reclaimed. `committed` is set only when the run finished
with zero failures, so `rollback --list` distinguishes a clean run from a half-applied one;
each destructive filesystem op journals its undo *before* the write, so a crash mid-op is
still reversible. `source --resume` continues the interrupted run in place (its id + backup
tree) rather than opening a new one. Mutating runs also
**back up** any displaced file under `…/backups/<run-id>/`. `boom rollback` replays a run's
`done` rows in reverse (remove created links, restore backups, re-apply a macOS default's
prior value) — like a Mother Box, it remembers everything and can put it back; `--dry-run`
previews the replay. The manifest
drives orphan reaping (verify warns; sync reaps), and a legacy TSV manifest is
imported once on upgrade. Breadcrumbs (`config`, `code`) record the config repo (path +
remote) and code dir.

## Distribution

`install.sh` downloads the matching binary from the GitHub release; `Formula/boom.rb`
installs it via Homebrew (the repo doubles as the tap). `release.yml` cross-compiles the
matrix on Linux, then **signs the macOS binaries on a real macOS runner** before
assembling the release and computing checksums over the final binaries. Signing is
ad-hoc by default (valid on Apple Silicon); add the `MACOS_*`/`APPLE_*` repo secrets to
switch on Developer ID signing + notarization (see the header of `release.yml`).
`install.sh`/`boom upgrade` only re-sign ad-hoc when a download fails verification, so a
notarized binary is never clobbered.
