// Command names + one-line briefs, DERIVED from the @stricli route map (cli.ts) — not a
// hand-maintained table. Completions, the man page, and the skill all read from here, so a
// command's name/brief can never drift from its route: the route *is* the source of truth.
//
// Lazy on purpose. These are functions, not top-level consts, because cli.ts imports the
// generator commands (completions/man/skill) that import this module — a cycle. Reading
// `routes` only at call time (help/generator execution, long after module load) lets the
// cycle resolve cleanly; a top-level `routes.getAllEntries()` here would run mid-load,
// before cli.ts has assigned `routes`.
