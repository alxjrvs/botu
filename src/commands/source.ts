// `boom source` — reconcile your machine from its config source. Bare `boom source` runs
// the sync verb (the route map's `defaultCommand`), the "make it so" reconcile. The
// subcommands operate the source itself — the git remote your machine is reconciled from,
// and its managed clone: `set` points boom at a repo (clone + record, then sync); the rest
// (`diff|push|reset`) operate the clone in place without cd-ing into the cache dir it lives
// in — `push` commits and pushes local edits in one step. A nested route map so the whole
// config-source story is one namespace; each verb is a thin wrapper over its engine module,
// and the clone-operating ones share the single `requireConfigBreadcrumb` guard.
