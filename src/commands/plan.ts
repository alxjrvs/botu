// than a flag on `source`. It runs the *same* reconcile walk in dry-run (so it can never drift
// from what a real sync does), projected as `~ would …` plan lines grouped by category. `--fix`
// previews the drift-repair sync instead — surfacing the exact set of conflicting, non-boom-owned
// files that an overwrite would replace, which the default safe plan reports only as "skipped".
